  Questions Before Finalizing

  Priority & Scope

  1. Platform Priority: Should I prioritize Web or Android? Or implement both in parallel for each phase?
  2. MVP Scope: For the hackathon demo, which phases are must-have vs nice-to-have? I suggest:
    - Must-have: Phase 1 (Practice + Progress) + Phase 2 (Focus on Web)
    - Nice-to-have: Phase 3 (Peer), Phase 4 (Gamification)
  3. Focus Mode Web: The components exist but aren't integrated into a full flow. Should this be a standalone page or embedded in Practice mode?

  Technical Decisions

  4. Offline Strategy:
    - Option A: Simple queue-based (offline actions queued, sync when online)
    - Option B: Full offline-first with conflict resolution
    - Which approach for the hackathon?
  5. Peer Collaboration Scope:
    - Full video/audio via WebRTC?
    - Or text chat + shared quiz only (simpler)?
  6. Whiteboard:
    - Build custom canvas-based whiteboard?
    - Or integrate existing library (e.g., tldraw, excalidraw)?
  7. Gamification Complexity:
    - Simple (XP + streaks only)?
    - Or full system (levels, badges, leaderboards)?

  Data & AI

  8. Question Storage: Should generated questions be cached in DB for reuse, or always generate fresh?
  9. Adaptive Difficulty:
    - Rule-based (if score < 60% → easier)?
    - Or more sophisticated algorithm?
  10. Study Plan Generation: The endpoint exists (/questions/generate/study-plan). Should this be surfaced in the dashboard as a personalized recommendation?

  Design

  11. Tech Stack Discrepancy: The PPT mentions Flutter for mobile, but the codebase uses Kotlin/Compose. Should I continue with Kotlin or is there a plan to switch?
  12. Community Notes Moderation: Manual review? Or auto-publish with report system?

  Let me know your answers to these questions, and I'll refine the plan with specific implementation details for each phase.
